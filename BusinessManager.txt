to do:
======

- For Proceed to Payment:
	- no need to restrict sale if inventory falls to zero or below
	  since it IS point of sale, meaning attendant has possession of
	  the physical item. However, if inventory falls below zero issue
	  warning to attendant that there is something wrong with the
	  inventory count for the given product or products falling below
	  zero.	

	- get form and amount of payment

	- if payment is less than total of sale, and if authorized for 
	  credit, process credit receivable

	- if payment equals total amount of sale, conclude the sale and print
	  sale ticket.

	- if payment is greater than total of sale, conclude sale, print ticket
	  and display change amount.
